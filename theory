Openfabric AI is a decentralized platform designed to let developers and businesses build, deploy, and use AI services in a secure, trustable environment. Its key features include:
Decentralized AI Operating System: Runs on a peer-to-peer network with consensus protocols to ensure reliability and fault tolerance.
AI Marketplace & Developer Tools: Provides SDKs, CLI tools, and a marketplace for easy deployment and discovery of AI apps.
Trusted Execution Environment (TEE): Keeps sensitive data and AI model execution secure.
Ontology & Standardization: Ensures AI services, datasets, and pipelines follow common input/output formats for interoperability.
Governance & Token Economy: Supports voting, staking, and rewards via OFN tokens.
Scalability & Resource Sharing: Enables infrastructure providers to offer computing power and data providers to share datasets.
Potential Testing Challenges:
Testing distributed consensus and node failures.
Validating AI app interoperability and ontology compliance.
Ensuring TEE security and data privacy.
Verifying governance workflows and token economics.
Checking platform scalability, performance, and fault recovery.

Positive Scenarios (Expected Behavior):
User can register an AI app with correct metadata.
AI app can be discovered using search and filters.
Payments using OFN tokens succeed for app usage.
SDK/CLI correctly deploys and updates an AI app.

Negative Scenarios (Error Handling):
Registration fails if required metadata is missing.
Deployment fails if AI app violates ontology rules.
Payments fail if OFN balance is insufficient.
Marketplace shows meaningful errors when a node is offline.

Bug: AI app deployment fails intermittently on testnet.
Severity: High
Steps to Reproduce:
Use SDK to deploy a new AI app.
Monitor deployment status.
Deployment fails in 1 of 5 attempts.
Potential Impact: Delays in publishing AI apps; could affect trust in marketplace.

Identify & Log: Record failure details, steps, inputs, and timestamps.
Check Dependencies: Verify network, node availability, and testnet health.
Compare Environments: Test in local vs. testnet environment.
Isolate Component: Narrow down if the issue is SDK, marketplace, or consensus.
Consult Documentation / Support: Check Openfabric docs for version updates or known issues.
Implement Fix & Retest: Adjust configuration, retry test, and log results.

Explaining a Technical Issue to a Non-Technical Stakeholder ?
Imagine our AI marketplace as a library. Sometimes, when someone adds a new book (AI app),
the catalog system doesn’t immediately recognize it due to network delays or system rules.
We’re investigating why the registration fails occasionally, fixing it so every book appears 
in the catalog reliably, ensuring our users can always find and use new AI services
